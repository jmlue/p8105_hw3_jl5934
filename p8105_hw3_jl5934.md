# Problem 1

## Describing the dataset

- There are 1384617 rows and 15 columns in the `instacart` dataframe.

- The variables included are order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order,
  reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow,
  order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id,
  department_id, aisle, department.

- There are 134 aisles in the dataframe.

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>%
  head(3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle_id |  n_obs |

|       83 | 150609 |
|       24 | 150473 |
|      123 |  78493 |

- The top 3 aisles from where purchases are ordered from are Aisle 83
  (150609 purchases), 24 (150473 purchases), and 123 (78493 purchases).

``` r
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>%

# Problem 2

First we will set up our dataframe by reading in the `brfss_smart2010`,
cleaning the names, filtering based on `topic` being about “Overall
Health”, change the variable response to a factor, rename variables to
something more appropriate, and remove ones we will not need to work
with.

``` r
BRFSS <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
    mutate(response = response %>%
           fct_relevel("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) %>%
  rename(overall_health = response, county = locationdesc, state = locationabbr, response_proportion = data_value) %>%
  select(-c(confidence_limit_high, confidence_limit_low, display_order, data_value_unit, data_value_type, data_value_footnote, data_value_footnote_symbol, class_id, topic_id, location_id, question_id, respid, geo_location))
```

``` r
BRFSS %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  distinct(state, year, county) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  filter(n_obs >= 7) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| state | n_obs |

| FL    |     7 |
| MA    |     8 |
| NC    |     7 |
| NJ    |     8 |
| PA    |    10 |

- There are 7 states with more than 7 observations in 2002.

``` r
BRFSS %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  distinct(state, year, county) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%

- There are 14 states with ore than 7 observations in 2010.

``` r
BRFSS %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(overall_health == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(mean_response_prop = mean(response_proportion)) %>%
  select(year, state, mean_response_prop) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_response_prop)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = state)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Mean Proportion Response", title = "Plot of mean proportion who responded Excellent to Overall Health by state over time")  
```

When plotting the mean values of `response_proportion` for the multiple
locations of a state, by year we are able to create a spaghetti plot
showing the changes from 2002-2010.

- When looking at the general trends across all the states, there does
  seem to be a downward proportion of those responding ‘Excellent’ that
  plateaus around 2005-2006 at 22%.

``` r
BRFSS %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(year %in% c("2006", "2010"), state == "NY", topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  group_by(overall_health, county, year) %>%
  mutate(mean_response_prop = mean(response_proportion)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= county, y = mean_response_prop, fill = overall_health)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Overall Health Respones Level", y = "Proportion of Response", title = "Porportion of Respones to Overall health Question Among NY Counties for the years 2006 & 2010") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 0.9)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year))
```

``` r
  #viridis::scale_color_viridis(option = "magma") 
```

We have plotted the mean `data_value` for each location within NY (Bronx
County, Erie County, Kings County, Monroe County, Nassau County, New
York County, Queens County, Suffolk County, & Westchester County) for
the years 2006 and 2010 separately.

- Of note there were several counties without information in 2006:
  Bronx, Erie, Monroe.

- In general there seems to be a trend towards ore poor health, and
  lower excellent health over time.

# Problem 3

We will import the dataframes from NHANES for the acceleratomer data
`accel.df` and demographic data `covar.df`. We will filter out subhects
from the demographic dataframe `covar.df` based on age (remove those
less than 21 years), remove those with missing demographic data, and
recode `education` and `sex` as appropriate factors.

We will then combine them by `inner_join` to select out only subjects
who met the inclusion criteria from the filters placed on `covar.df`.

``` r
accel.df <- read_csv("p8105_hw3_jl5934_files/data/nhanes_accel.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
covar.df <- read_csv("p8105_hw3_jl5934_files/data/nhanes_covar.csv",
                     skip = 4) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(age > 21) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(education = as.factor(education) %>%
           fct_recode("Less_than_HS" = "1", "HS_equivalent" = "2", "More_than_HS" = "3")) %>%
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex) %>% 
           fct_recode("male" = "1", "female" = "2"))
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5

``` r
accel_covar.df <- inner_join(covar.df, accel.df, by = "seqn")
```

Producing a table for count of men and women in each education category.

``` r
accel_covar.df %>%
  group_by(sex, education) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

| sex    | education     | n_obs |
|:-------|:--------------|------:|
| male   | Less_than_HS  |    27 |
| male   | HS_equivalent |    34 |
| male   | More_than_HS  |    54 |
| female | Less_than_HS  |    28 |
| female | HS_equivalent |    23 |
| female | More_than_HS  |    59 |

- For both Males and Females, the majority had education that was more
  than high school equivalent. However in second rank for males was high
  school equivalent and last less then high school; whereas for females
  it was less than high school in second rank then high school
  equivalent in last rank.

Making plot of age distribution by education level and sex.

``` r
accel_covar.df %>%
  group_by(sex, education) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = education)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Age in Years", title = "Age distribution of education levels by sex") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex))
```

![](p8105_hw3_jl5934_files/figure-gfm/plot%20for%20table%20count%20by%20sex/education-1.png)<!-- -->

- For education level matched groups, the females seem to have a lower
  median age for more than HS, higher for HS equivalent, and very
  slightly lower age for less than HS.

- In both gender groups, there is a much small distribution of ages for
  the less than HS group compared to the other two. In addition, in both
  groups, the lowest age median is in the ore than high school (for
  males the highest is less than HS, and for females the highest is HS
  equivalent)

Next we will make a plot that creates a new variable `Total_activity`
that is the aggregate of the total accelerometer readings for the
24-hour period for an individual.

``` r
accel_covar.df %>%
  mutate(Total_activity = rowSums(.[6:1445])) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = Total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se= FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Age in years", y = "Total Activity", title = "Total activity by age, education, and sex") +
  scale_color_hue(direction = -1) +
  facet_grid(education ~ .)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_jl5934_files/figure-gfm/Total%20activity%20plot-1.png)<!-- -->

- This plot demonstrates that across all education levels and both
  genders, the total activity level decreases with age.

  - For lower education levels there is a trend towards higher overall
    levels of total activity until about age 60 where they all have a
    decrease.

  - In addition, females tend to have lower total activity levels across
    all education levels at younger ages, but this flips around 50 years
    for those with less than high school education.

![](p8105_hw3_jl5934_files/figure-gfm/24-insepction%20by%20eduation%20and%20sex-1.png)<!-- -->

- Looking at the plot demonstrates that there is generally a decrease in
  activity in the midday, and among all the education groups and both
  genders there seem to be two separate groups that are either diurnal
  or nocturnal in their activities.
